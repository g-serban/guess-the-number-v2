# guess-the-number-v2

Think of an number between 1 and 1000.
The computer is going to try to guess your number. Press l if the number is lower's than yours, press h if the number is higher than yours or press c if the computer guessed your number.
Try to see in how many guesses can he find your number.

The program is just a tiny function with 20 lines of code, but it took me more than 1 hour to figure it out!
